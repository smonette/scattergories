- A pen
- A piece of paper with 12 bullets

## Gameplay
1. See what the randomly generated letter is (and regenerate if you want)
2. Press play on the timer
3. Write down words that start with that letter as fast as you can!
4. After 2 minutes time is up! Put your pen down!
5. Score everyones list
6. Click next game to move on to the enxt set of prompts

## Scoring
- 1 point for every complete/valid answer
- If another player has the same answer you *both* lose the point
- Alliteration counts for additional points. 
    >For example: Mickey Mouse would be 2 points.
- Iffy answers are subject to group vote.
